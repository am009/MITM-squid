#	WELCOME TO SQUID 3.1.19
#	----------------------------
#	
#	This is the documentation for the Squid configuration file.
#	This documentation can also be found online at:
#		http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/
#	
#	You may wish to look at the Squid home page and wiki for the
#	FAQ and other documentation:
#		http://www.squid-cache.org/
#		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq
#		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples
#	
#	This documentation shows what the defaults for various directives
#	happen to be.  If you don't need to change the default, you should
#	leave the line out of your squid.conf in most cases.
#	
#	In some cases "none" refers to no default setting at all,
#	while in other cases it refers to the value of the option
#	- the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the case.
#

#  Configuration options can be included using the "include" directive.
#  Include takes a list of files to include. Quoting and wildcards are
#  supported.
#
#  For example,
#
#  include /path/to/included/file/squid.acl.config
#
#  Includes can be nested up to a hard-coded depth of 16 levels.
#  This arbitrary restriction is to prevent recursive include references
#  from causing Squid entering an infinite loop whilst trying to load
#  configuration files.

#  TAG: dns_testnames
#	Remove this line. DNS is no longer tested on startup.
#Default:
# none

#	Since squid-3.0 use the 'disable-pmtu-discovery' flag on http_port instead.
#Default:
# none

# OPTIONS FOR AUTHENTICATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: auth_param
#	This is used to define parameters for the various authentication
#	schemes supported by Squid.
#
#	format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]
#
#	The order in which authentication schemes are presented to the client is
#	dependent on the order the scheme first appears in config file. IE
#	has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
#	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
#	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
#	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
#	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
#	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
#	program entry).
#
#	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
#	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
#	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
#	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.
#
#	Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes
#	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
#	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
#	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
#	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
#	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
#	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
#	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
#	type acl.
#
#	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
#	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
#	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
#	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.
#	Ports flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have
#	authentication disabled.
#
#	=== Parameters for the basic scheme follow. ===
#
#	"program" cmdline
#	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a program
#	reads a line containing "username password" and replies "OK" or
#	"ERR" in an endless loop. "ERR" responses may optionally be followed
#	by a error description available as %m in the returned error page.
#	If you use an authenticator, make sure you have 1 acl of type
#	proxy_auth.
#
#	By default, the basic authentication scheme is not used unless a
#	program is specified.
#
#	If you want to use the traditional NCSA proxy authentication, set
#	this line to something like
#
#	auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid3/ncsa_auth /usr/etc/passwd
#
#	"utf8" on|off
#	HTTP uses iso-latin-1 as characterset, while some authentication
#	backends such as LDAP expects UTF-8. If this is set to on Squid will
#	translate the HTTP iso-latin-1 charset to UTF-8 before sending the
#	username & password to the helper.
#
#	"children" numberofchildren
#	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
#	Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
#	verifications, slowing it down. When password verifications are
#	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
#	authenticator processes.
#	auth_param basic children 5
#
#	"concurrency" concurrency
#	The number of concurrent requests the helper can process.
#	The default of 0 is used for helpers who only supports
#	one request at a time. Setting this changes the protocol used to
#	include a channel number first on the request/response line, allowing
#	multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallell without
#	wating for the response.
#	Must not be set unless it's known the helper supports this.
#	auth_param basic concurrency 0
#
#	"realm" realmstring
#	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the
#	client for the basic proxy authentication scheme (part of
#	the text the user will see when prompted their username and
#	password). There is no default.
#	auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
#
#	"credentialsttl" timetolive
#	Specifies how long squid assumes an externally validated
#	username:password pair is valid for - in other words how
#	often the helper program is called for that user. Set this
#	low to force revalidation with short lived passwords.  Note
#	setting this high does not impact your susceptibility
#	to replay attacks unless you are using an one-time password
#	system (such as SecureID).  If you are using such a system,
#	you will be vulnerable to replay attacks unless you also
#	use the max_user_ip ACL in an http_access rule.
#
#	"casesensitive" on|off
#	Specifies if usernames are case sensitive. Most user databases are
#	case insensitive allowing the same username to be spelled using both
#	lower and upper case letters, but some are case sensitive. This
#	makes a big difference for user_max_ip ACL processing and similar.
#	auth_param basic casesensitive off
#
#	=== Parameters for the digest scheme follow ===
#
#	"program" cmdline
#	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such
#	a program reads a line containing "username":"realm" and
#	replies with the appropriate H(A1) value hex encoded or
#	ERR if the user (or his H(A1) hash) does not exists.
#	See rfc 2616 for the definition of H(A1).
#	"ERR" responses may optionally be followed by a error description
#	available as %m in the returned error page.
#
#	By default, the digest authentication scheme is not used unless a
#	program is specified.
#
#	If you want to use a digest authenticator, set this line to
#	something like
#
#	auth_param digest program /usr/lib/squid3/digest_pw_auth /usr/etc/digpass
#
#	"utf8" on|off
#	HTTP uses iso-latin-1 as characterset, while some authentication
#	backends such as LDAP expects UTF-8. If this is set to on Squid will
#	translate the HTTP iso-latin-1 charset to UTF-8 before sending the
#	username & password to the helper.
#
#	"children" numberofchildren
#	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
#	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
#	process a backlog of H(A1) calculations, slowing it down.
#	When the H(A1) calculations are done via a (slow) network
#	you are likely to need lots of authenticator processes.
#	auth_param digest children 5
#
#	"realm" realmstring
#	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the
#	client for the digest proxy authentication scheme (part of
#	the text the user will see when prompted their username and
#	password). There is no default.
#	auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server
#
#	"nonce_garbage_interval" timeinterval
#	Specifies the interval that nonces that have been issued
#	to client_agent's are checked for validity.
#
#	"nonce_max_duration" timeinterval
#	Specifies the maximum length of time a given nonce will be
#	valid for.
#
#	"nonce_max_count" number
#	Specifies the maximum number of times a given nonce can be
#	used.
#
#	"nonce_strictness" on|off
#	Determines if squid requires strict increment-by-1 behavior
#	for nonce counts, or just incrementing (off - for use when
#	useragents generate nonce counts that occasionally miss 1
#	(ie, 1,2,4,6)). Default off.
#
#	"check_nonce_count" on|off
#	This directive if set to off can disable the nonce count check
#	completely to work around buggy digest qop implementations in
#	certain mainstream browser versions. Default on to check the
#	nonce count to protect from authentication replay attacks.
#
#	"post_workaround" on|off
#	This is a workaround to certain buggy browsers who sends
#	an incorrect request digest in POST requests when reusing
#	the same nonce as acquired earlier on a GET request.
#
#	=== NTLM scheme options follow ===
#
#	"program" cmdline
#	Specify the command for the external NTLM authenticator.
#	Such a program reads exchanged NTLMSSP packets with
#	the browser via Squid until authentication is completed.
#	If you use an NTLM authenticator, make sure you have 1 acl
#	of type proxy_auth.  By default, the NTLM authenticator_program
#	is not used.
#
#	auth_param ntlm program /usr/lib/squid3/ntlm_auth
#
#	"children" numberofchildren
#	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
#	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
#	process a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it
#	down. When credential verifications are done via a (slow)
#	network you are likely to need lots of authenticator
#	processes.
#
#	auth_param ntlm children 5
#
#	"keep_alive" on|off
#	Whether to keep the connection open after the initial response where
#	Squid tells the browser which schemes are supported by the proxy.
#	Some browsers are known to present many login popups or to corrupt
#	POST/PUT requests transfer if the connection is not closed.
#	The default is currently OFF to avoid this, but may change.
#	
#	auth_param ntlm keep_alive on
#
#	=== Options for configuring the NEGOTIATE auth-scheme follow ===
#
#	"program" cmdline
#	Specify the command for the external Negotiate authenticator.
#	This protocol is used in Microsoft Active-Directory enabled setups with
#	the Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browsers.
#	Its main purpose is to exchange credentials with the Squid proxy
#	using the Kerberos mechanisms.
#	If you use a Negotiate authenticator, make sure you have at least
#	one acl of type proxy_auth active. By default, the negotiate
#	authenticator_program is not used.
#	The only supported program for this role is the ntlm_auth
#	program distributed as part of Samba, version 4 or later.
#
#	auth_param negotiate program /usr/lib/squid3/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=gss-spnego
#
#	"children" numberofchildren
#	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
#	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
#	process a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it
#	down. When crendential verifications are done via a (slow)
#	network you are likely to need lots of authenticator
#	processes.
#	auth_param negotiate children 5
#
#	"keep_alive" on|off
#	Whether to keep the connection open after the initial response where
#	Squid tells the browser which schemes are supported by the proxy.
#	Some browsers are known to present many login popups or to corrupt
#	POST/PUT requests transfer if the connection is not closed.
#	The default is currently OFF to avoid this, but may change.
#	
#	auth_param negotiate keep_alive on
#
#
#	Examples:
#
##Recommended minimum configuration per scheme:
##auth_param negotiate program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>
##auth_param negotiate children 5
##auth_param negotiate keep_alive on
##
##auth_param ntlm program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>
##auth_param ntlm children 5
##auth_param ntlm keep_alive on
##
##auth_param digest program <uncomment and complete this line>
##auth_param digest children 5
##auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server
##auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes
##auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 30 minutes
##auth_param digest nonce_max_count 50
##
##auth_param basic program <uncomment and complete this line>
##auth_param basic children 5
##auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
##auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: authenticate_cache_garbage_interval
#	The time period between garbage collection across the username cache.
#	This is a tradeoff between memory utilization (long intervals - say
#	2 days) and CPU (short intervals - say 1 minute). Only change if you
#	have good reason to.
#Default:
# authenticate_cache_garbage_interval 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ttl
#	The time a user & their credentials stay in the logged in
#	user cache since their last request. When the garbage
#	interval passes, all user credentials that have passed their
#	TTL are removed from memory.
#Default:
# authenticate_ttl 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ip_ttl
#	If you use proxy authentication and the 'max_user_ip' ACL,
#	this directive controls how long Squid remembers the IP
#	addresses associated with each user.  Use a small value
#	(e.g., 60 seconds) if your users might change addresses
#	quickly, as is the case with dialups.   You might be safe
#	using a larger value (e.g., 2 hours) in a corporate LAN
#	environment with relatively static address assignments.
#Default:
# authenticate_ip_ttl 0 seconds

# ACCESS CONTROLS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: external_acl_type
#	This option defines external acl classes using a helper program
#	to look up the status
#
#	  external_acl_type name [options] FORMAT.. /path/to/helper [helper arguments..]
#
#	Options:
#
#	  ttl=n		TTL in seconds for cached results (defaults to 3600
#	  		for 1 hour)
#	  negative_ttl=n
#	  		TTL for cached negative lookups (default same
#	  		as ttl)
#	  children=n	Number of acl helper processes spawn to service
#			external acl lookups of this type. (default 5)
#	  concurrency=n	concurrency level per process. Only used with helpers
#			capable of processing more than one query at a time.
#	  cache=n	result cache size, 0 is unbounded (default)
#	  grace=n	Percentage remaining of TTL where a refresh of a
#			cached entry should be initiated without needing to
#			wait for a new reply. (default 0 for no grace period)
#	  protocol=2.5	Compatibility mode for Squid-2.5 external acl helpers
#	  ipv4 / ipv6	IP-mode used to communicate to this helper.
#			For compatability with older configurations and helpers
#			the default is currently 'ipv4'.
#
#	FORMAT specifications
#
#	  %LOGIN	Authenticated user login name
#	  %EXT_USER	Username from external acl
#	  %IDENT	Ident user name
#	  %SRC		Client IP
#	  %SRCPORT	Client source port

#	  %DST		Requested host
#	  %PROTO	Requested protocol
#	  %PORT		Requested port
#	  %PATH		Requested URL path
#	  %METHOD	Request method
#	  %MYADDR	Squid interface address
#	  %MYPORT	Squid http_port number
#	  %PATH		Requested URL-path (including query-string if any)
#	  %USER_CERT	SSL User certificate in PEM format
#	  %USER_CERTCHAIN SSL User certificate chain in PEM format
#	  %USER_CERT_xx	SSL User certificate subject attribute xx
#	  %USER_CA_xx	SSL User certificate issuer attribute xx
#
#	  %>{Header}	HTTP request header "Header"
#	  %>{Hdr:member}
#	  		HTTP request header "Hdr" list member "member"
#	  %>{Hdr:;member}
#	  		HTTP request header list member using ; as
#	  		list separator. ; can be any non-alphanumeric
#			character.
#
#	  %<{Header}	HTTP reply header "Header"
#	  %<{Hdr:member}
#	  		HTTP reply header "Hdr" list member "member"
#	  %<{Hdr:;member}
#	  		HTTP reply header list member using ; as
#	  		list separator. ; can be any non-alphanumeric
#			character.
#
#	  %%		The percent sign. Useful for helpers which need
#			an unchanging input format.
#
#	In addition to the above, any string specified in the referencing
#	acl will also be included in the helper request line, after the
#	specified formats (see the "acl external" directive)
#
#	The helper receives lines per the above format specification,
#	and returns lines starting with OK or ERR indicating the validity
#	of the request and optionally followed by additional keywords with
#	more details.
#
#	General result syntax:
#
#	  OK/ERR keyword=value ...
#
#	Defined keywords:
#
#	  user=		The users name (login)
#	  password=	The users password (for login= cache_peer option)
#	  message=	Message describing the reason. Available as %o
#	  		in error pages
#	  tag=		Apply a tag to a request (for both ERR and OK results)
#	  		Only sets a tag, does not alter existing tags.
#	  log=		String to be logged in access.log. Available as
#	  		%ea in logformat specifications
#
#	If protocol=3.0 (the default) then URL escaping is used to protect
#	each value in both requests and responses.
#
#	If using protocol=2.5 then all values need to be enclosed in quotes
#	if they may contain whitespace, or the whitespace escaped using \.
#	And quotes or \ characters within the keyword value must be \ escaped.
#
#	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
#	introducing a query channel tag infront of the request/response.
#	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: acl
#	Defining an Access List
#
#	Every access list definition must begin with an aclname and acltype, 
#	followed by either type-specific arguments or a quoted filename that
#	they are read from.
#
#	   acl aclname acltype argument ...
#	   acl aclname acltype "file" ...
#
#	When using "file", the file should contain one item per line.
#
#	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.
#	To make them case-insensitive, use the -i option. To return case-sensitive
#	use the +i option between patterns, or make a new ACL line without -i.
#
#	Some acl types require suspending the current request in order
#	to access some external data source.
#	Those which do are marked with the tag [slow], those which
#	don't are marked as [fast].
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl

#	  # in access.log.
#	  #
#	  # NOTE: proxy_auth requires a EXTERNAL authentication program
#	  # to check username/password combinations (see
#	  # auth_param directive).
#	  #
#	  # NOTE: proxy_auth can't be used in a transparent/intercepting proxy
#	  # as the browser needs to be configured for using a proxy in order
#	  # to respond to proxy authentication.
#
#	acl aclname snmp_community string ...
#	  # A community string to limit access to your SNMP Agent [fast]
#	  # Example:
#	  #
#	  #	acl snmppublic snmp_community public
#
#	acl aclname maxconn number
#	  # This will be matched when the client's IP address has
#	  # more than <number> TCP connections established. [fast]
#	  # NOTE: This only measures direct TCP links so X-Forwarded-For
#	  # indirect clients are not counted.
#
#	acl aclname max_user_ip [-s] number
#	  # This will be matched when the user attempts to log in from more
#	  # than <number> different ip addresses. The authenticate_ip_ttl
#	  # parameter controls the timeout on the ip entries. [fast]
#	  # If -s is specified the limit is strict, denying browsing
#	  # from any further IP addresses until the ttl has expired. Without
#	  # -s Squid will just annoy the user by "randomly" denying requests.
#	  # (the counter is reset each time the limit is reached and a
#	  # request is denied)
#	  # NOTE: in acceleration mode or where there is mesh of child proxies,
#	  # clients may appear to come from multiple addresses if they are
#	  # going through proxy farms, so a limit of 1 may cause user problems.
#
#	acl aclname req_mime_type [-i] mime-type ...
#	  # regex match against the mime type of the request generated
#	  # by the client. Can be used to detect file upload or some
#	  # types HTTP tunneling requests [fast]
#	  # NOTE: This does NOT match the reply. You cannot use this
#	  # to match the returned file type.
#
#	acl aclname req_header header-name [-i] any\.regex\.here
#	  # regex match against any of the known request headers.  May be
#	  # thought of as a superset of "browser", "referer" and "mime-type"

#
#	acl aclname rep_mime_type [-i] mime-type ...
#	  # regex match against the mime type of the reply received by
#	  # squid. Can be used to detect file download or some
#	  # types HTTP tunneling requests. [fast]
#	  # NOTE: This has no effect in http_access rules. It only has

#  TAG: follow_x_forwarded_for
#	Allowing or Denying the X-Forwarded-For header to be followed to
#	find the original source of a request.
#
#	Requests may pass through a chain of several other proxies
#	before reaching us.  The X-Forwarded-For header will contain a
#	comma-separated list of the IP addresses in the chain, with the
#	rightmost address being the most recent.
#
#	If a request reaches us from a source that is allowed by this
#	configuration item, then we consult the X-Forwarded-For header
#	to see where that host received the request from.  If the
#	X-Forwarded-For header contains multiple addresses, we continue
#	backtracking until we reach an address for which we are not allowed
#	to follow the X-Forwarded-For header, or until we reach the first
#	address in the list. For the purpose of ACL used in the
#	follow_x_forwarded_for directive the src ACL type always matches
#	the address we are testing and srcdomain matches its rDNS.
#
#	The end result of this process is an IP address that we will
#	refer to as the indirect client address.  This address may
#	be treated as the client address for access control, ICAP, delay
#	pools and logging, depending on the acl_uses_indirect_client,
#	icap_uses_indirect_client, delay_pool_uses_indirect_client and
#	log_uses_indirect_client options.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
#
#		Any host for which we follow the X-Forwarded-For header
#		can place incorrect information in the header, and Squid
#		will use the incorrect information as if it were the
#		source address of the request.  This may enable remote
#		hosts to bypass any access control restrictions that are
#		based on the client's source addresses.
#
#	For example:
#
#		acl localhost src 127.0.0.1
#		acl my_other_proxy srcdomain .proxy.example.com
#		follow_x_forwarded_for allow localhost
#		follow_x_forwarded_for allow my_other_proxy
#Default:
# follow_x_forwarded_for deny all

#  TAG: acl_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client address
#	(see follow_x_forwarded_for) is used instead of the
#	direct client address in acl matching.
#
#	NOTE: maxconn ACL considers direct TCP links and indirect
#	      clients will always have zero. So no match.
#Default:
# acl_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: delay_pool_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client address
#	(see follow_x_forwarded_for) is used instead of the
#	direct client address in delay pools.
#Default:
# delay_pool_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: log_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client address
#	(see follow_x_forwarded_for) is used instead of the
#	direct client address in the access log.
#Default:
# log_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: http_access
#	Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists
#
#	Access to the HTTP port:
#	http_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	NOTE on default values:
#
#	If there are no "access" lines present, the default is to deny
#	the request.
#
#	If none of the "access" lines cause a match, the default is the
#	opposite of the last line in the list.  If the last line was
#	deny, the default is allow.  Conversely, if the last line
#	is allow, the default will be deny.  For these reasons, it is a
#	good idea to have an "deny all" entry at the end of your access
#	lists to avoid potential confusion.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Default:
# http_access deny all
#

#
# Recommended minimum Access Permission configuration:
#
# Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
#http_access allow manager localhost
#http_access deny manager

# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
#http_access deny !Safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
#http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

#  TAG: adapted_http_access
#	Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists
#
#	Essentially identical to http_access, but runs after redirectors

#  TAG: http_reply_access
#	Allow replies to client requests. This is complementary to http_access.
#
#	http_reply_access allow|deny [!] aclname ...
#
#	NOTE: if there are no access lines present, the default is to allow
#	all replies
#
#	If none of the access lines cause a match the opposite of the
#	last line will apply. Thus it is good practice to end the rules
#	with an "allow all" or "deny all" entry.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.

#	access lists
#
#	htcp_access  allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	See http_access for details
#
#	NOTE: The default if no htcp_access lines are present is to
#	deny all traffic. This default may cause problems with peers
#	using the htcp or htcp-oldsquid options.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
## Allow HTCP queries from local networks only
##htcp_access allow localnet
##htcp_access deny all
#Default:

#  TAG: htcp_clr_access
#	Allowing or Denying access to purge content using HTCP based

#	htcp_clr_access  allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	See http_access for details
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.

#
## Allow HTCP CLR requests from trusted peers
#acl htcp_clr_peer src 172.16.1.2
#htcp_clr_access allow htcp_clr_peer
#Default:
# htcp_clr_access deny all

#  TAG: miss_access
#	Determins whether network access is permitted when satisfying a request.
#
#	For example;
#	    to force your neighbors to use you as a sibling instead of
#	    a parent.
#
#		acl localclients src 172.16.0.0/16
#		miss_access allow localclients
#		miss_access deny  !localclients
#
#	This means only your local clients are allowed to fetch relayed/MISS
#	replies from the network and all other clients can only fetch cached
#	objects (HITs).
#
#
#	The default for this setting allows all clients who passed the
#	http_access rules to relay via this proxy.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# miss_access allow all

#  TAG: ident_lookup_access
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, cause an ident
#	(RFC 931) lookup to be performed for this request.  For
#	example, you might choose to always perform ident lookups
#	for your main multi-user Unix boxes, but not for your Macs
#	and PCs.  By default, ident lookups are not performed for
#	any requests.
#
#	To enable ident lookups for specific client addresses, you
#	can follow this example:
#
#	acl ident_aware_hosts src 198.168.1.0/24
#	ident_lookup_access allow ident_aware_hosts
#	ident_lookup_access deny all
#
#	Only src type ACL checks are fully supported.  A srcdomain
#	ACL might work at times, but it will not always provide
#	the correct result.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# ident_lookup_access deny all

#  TAG: reply_body_max_size	size [acl acl...]
#	This option specifies the maximum size of a reply body. It can be
#	used to prevent users from downloading very large files, such as
#	MP3's and movies. When the reply headers are received, the
#	reply_body_max_size lines are processed, and the first line where
#	all (if any) listed ACLs are true is used as the maximum body size
#	for this reply.
#
#	This size is checked twice. First when we get the reply headers,
#	we check the content-length value.  If the content length value exists
#	and is larger than the allowed size, the request is denied and the
#	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
#	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
#	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
#	and they will receive a partial reply.
#
#	WARNING: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
#	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
#	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
#	use this option if you have downstream caches.
#
#	WARNING: A maximum size smaller than the size of squid's error messages
#	will cause an infinite loop and crash squid. Ensure that the smallest
#	non-zero value you use is greater that the maximum header size plus
#	the size of your largest error page.
#
#	If you set this parameter none (the default), there will be
#	no limit imposed.
#
#	Configuration Format is:
#		reply_body_max_size SIZE UNITS [acl ...]
#	ie.
#		reply_body_max_size 10 MB
#
#Default:
# none

# NETWORK OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: http_port
#	Usage:	port [options]
#		hostname:port [options]
#		1.2.3.4:port [options]
#
#	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
#	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
#	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
#	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
#	address, Squid binds the socket to that specific
#	address.  This replaces the old 'tcp_incoming_address'
#	option.  Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
#	address, so you can use the port number alone.
#
#	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, you
#	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.
#
#	The -a command line option may be used to specify additional
#	port(s) where Squid listens for proxy request. Such ports will
#	be plain proxy ports with no options.
#
#	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.
#
#	Options:
#
#	   intercept	Support for IP-Layer interception of
#			outgoing requests without browser settings.
#			NP: disables authentication and IPv6 on the port.
#
#	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY for spoofing outgoing
#			connections using the client IP address.
#			NP: disables authentication and maybe IPv6 on the port.
#
#	   accel	Accelerator mode. Also needs at least one of
#			vhost / vport / defaultsite.
#
#	   allow-direct	Allow direct forwarding in accelerator mode. Normally
#			accelerated requests are denied direct forwarding as if
#			never_direct was used.
#
#	   defaultsite=domainname
#			What to use for the Host: header if it is not present
#			in a request. Determines what site (not origin server)
#			accelerators should consider the default.
#			Implies accel.
#
#	   vhost	Accelerator mode using Host header for virtual domain support.
#			Also uses the port as specified in Host: header unless
#			overridden by the vport option. Implies accel.
#
#	   vport	Virtual host port support. Using the http_port number
#			instead of the port passed on Host: headers. Implies accel.
#
#	   vport=NN	Virtual host port support. Using the specified port
#			number instead of the port passed on Host: headers.
#			Implies accel.
#
#	   protocol=	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated requests with.
#			Defaults to http.
#
#	   ignore-cc	Ignore request Cache-Control headers.
#
#	   		Warning: This option violates HTTP specifications if
#			used in non-accelerator setups.
#
#	   connection-auth[=on|off]
#	                use connection-auth=off to tell Squid to prevent 
#	                forwarding Microsoft connection oriented authentication
#			(NTLM, Negotiate and Kerberos)
#
#	   disable-pmtu-discovery=
#			Control Path-MTU discovery usage:
#			    off		lets OS decide on what to do (default).
#			    transparent	disable PMTU discovery when transparent
#					support is enabled.
#			    always	disable always PMTU discovery.
#
#			In many setups of transparently intercepting proxies
#			Path-MTU discovery can not work on traffic towards the
#			clients. This is the case when the intercepting device
#			does not fully track connections and fails to forward
#			ICMP must fragment messages to the cache server. If you
#			have such setup and experience that certain clients
#			sporadically hang or never complete requests set
#			disable-pmtu-discovery option to 'transparent'.
#
#	   ssl-bump 	Intercept each CONNECT request matching ssl_bump ACL,
#			establish secure connection with the client and with
#			the server, decrypt HTTP messages as they pass through
#			Squid, and treat them as unencrypted HTTP messages,
#			becoming the man-in-the-middle.
#
#			When this option is enabled, additional options become
#			available to specify SSL-related properties of the
#			client-side connection: cert, key, version, cipher,
#			options, clientca, cafile, capath, crlfile, dhparams,
#			sslflags, and sslcontext. See the https_port directive
#			for more information on these options.
#
#			The ssl_bump option is required to fully enable
#			the SslBump feature.
#
#	   name=	Specifies a internal name for the port. Defaults to
#			the port specification (port or addr:port)
#
#	   tcpkeepalive[=idle,interval,timeout]
#			Enable TCP keepalive probes of idle connections.
#			In seconds; idle is the initial time before TCP starts
#			probing the connection, interval how often to probe, and
#			timeout the time before giving up.
#
#	If you run Squid on a dual-homed machine with an internal
#	and an external interface we recommend you to specify the
#
